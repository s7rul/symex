# SYMEX

Symbolic execution engine that can operate on either LLVM IR or ARMv6-M/ARMv7-M or ARMv7-EM machine code. Main use is to analyze Rust programs but programs written in other languages can potentially be analyzed.
Because the library used to read LLVM bytecode is large and cumbersome is the LLVM IR part of the tool hidden behind the feature flag `llvm`.

Since Symex was originally written with only LLVM IR execution in mind are the integration of machine code execution not always done coherently.
Work is ongoing on how the two parts should coexist.
Because of this is the following documentation split up in two different parts one for LLVM IR and one for ARMv6-M machine code.

## Binary

### Getting started

The easiest way to use Symex is by the cargo-symex tool.
It can be installed by running:

```plain
cargo install --path cargo-symex
```

Then the examples can be executed by first navigating to the `armv6-m-examples` directory and executing:

```plain
cargo symex --elf --example [example name] --function [function name] (--release)
```

### Additional notes

- To analyze a function it must have an entry in the `.symtab` section of the elf file. All symbols in an elf file can be shown using the `readelf -s [path to elf file]` command. To tell rustc to not mangle the function name the attribute `#[no_mangle]` can be used.
- When using symex-lib functions or to be able to detect panic the debug-data must be included in the elf file.
  An elf file can directly be analyzed with cargo-symex by the `cargo symex --elf --path [path to elf file] --function [function name]`
- Symex can be directly used as a library see `wcet-analasis-example` directory for examples of how to do that.

### Notes on the max cycle count on armv6-m

The max cycle count for each path is calculated by counting the number of cycles for each instruction according to [this document](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0432/c/programmers-model/instruction-set-summary). It assumes a core without wait-states.

### Notes on cycle counting for armv7-(e)m

The cycle counting model does not contain any model of a branch predictor. This means that the branching model always flushes the pipeline thus incurring a lot more cycles estimated as soon as a branch can be predicted by the hardware.
This could be improved greatly by adding a branch prediction model. The cycle counting model also assumes that the code encounters zero wait states, i.e. the code is running from RAM. The Cycle counts for each instruction are based on the [cortex-m4 documentation](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0439/b/CHDDIGAC).

### Limitations for armv7-(e)m

The armv7 support lacks implementations for [`DSP`](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0403/d/Application-Level-Architecture/The-ARMv7-M-Instruction-Set/Data-processing-instructions/Parallel-addition-and-subtraction-instructions--DSP-extension) and the [`floating point extension`](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0403/d/Application-Level-Architecture/Application-Level-Programmers--Model/The-optional-Floating-point-extension). The DSP extension is parsable by the [`disarmv7`](https://github.com/ivario123/disarmv7) but is not implemented in the [decoder](symex/src/general_assembly/arch/arm/v7/decoder.rs).
Armv7 has support for hardware semaphores, at the time of writing these are not implemented in symex.

### Future work planned or unplanned

#### Improve testing suite

The assembly to symex GA translators needs further testing.

- The armv7 translator is only $\approx 26\%$ tested, due to the nature of this project we should strive to improve this.
- The armv6 translator lacks direct testing and should also be improved.

<details>
  <summary>Test percentage</summary>

The 26 percent comes from [llvm-test-cov](https://github.com/taiki-e/cargo-llvm-cov) which and corresponds to the lines covered. The reasoning behind including this number is simply that
it shows that more testing is needed.

</details>

#### Include [`DSP`](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0403/d/Application-Level-Architecture/The-ARMv7-M-Instruction-Set/Data-processing-instructions/Parallel-addition-and-subtraction-instructions--DSP-extension) instructions

The current (v7) implementation lacks support for [DSP](#limitations-for-armv7-em) instructions, most of these can be implemented without large changes.

#### Include [`floating point extension`](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0403/d/Application-Level-Architecture/Application-Level-Programmers--Model/The-optional-Floating-point-extension)

The current (v7) implementation lacks support for floating point instructions, these are also missing from the [`disarmv7`](https://github.com/ivario123/disarmv7) crate so implementing support for floating point is a more extensive change.

#### Include support for hardware semaphores

This is nontrivial as it extensive modeling of the system if it is to be useful. However, we could implement the baseline definition from the data sheet if we simply added a hashmap to keep track of which memory addresses are subject to a semaphore.

## LLVM IR

### Cargo subcommand

A cargo subcommand is available to easily compile Rust programs into bitcode files and run them
in the symbolic execution engine.

It can be installed with

```shell
> cargo install --path cargo-symex --features llvm
```

For usage instructions see `cargo symex --help`.

### Getting started

Check out the examples contained in `examles/examples`. These can be run with the cargo subcommand

```shell
> cd examples
> cargo-symex --example <example>
```

To compile and run the example `examples/rust_simple` using the cargo subcommand

```shell
> cd examples
> cargo symex --example simple --function rust_simple_test
```

This will display the results of the analysis of the example, showing all the paths it took and
concrete values for all inputs and output.

### Building

#### Dependencies

- [LLVM](https://llvm.org/), used as a library for decoding the LLVM-IR (internal representation)
  of the program under analysis.
- [boolector](https://github.com/Boolector/boolector), Boolector is a Satisfiability Modulo Theories
  (SMT) solver for the theories of fixed-size bit-vectors, arrays and uninterpreted functions.

The project currently uses LLVM 17 which require a relatively recent version of Rust.

#### Devcontainer

As an alternative, a [Dev Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/devcontainers/containers) is provided that automatically installs Rust `1.72` and LLVM 17.

To generate tests use `./symex/compile_tests_dc.sh` instead.

### Making tests work

The tests make use of compiled LLVM IR files which are not tracked by git. To make the tests work
run

```shell
> ./scripts/compile_tests.sh
```

### Known issues

Sometimes when running examples the runner may give

```shell
error: could not copy "<project_dir>/target/debug/examples/<some_file>.bc" to "<project_dir>/target/debug/examples/<some_file>.bc": No such file or directory (os error 2)

error: could not copy "<project_dir>/target/debug/examples/<some_file>.ll" to "<project_dir>/target/debug/examples/<some_file>.ll": No such file or directory (os error 2)

error: could not compile `examples` due to 2 previous errors
```

Until the issue is fixed it can remedied by running `cargo clean` and trying again.

## SYMEX LLVM 14

The older version `symex-llvm-14-legacy` is still available (for now). But it will be phased out later in favor of the more updated version that supports LLVM 17.

Due to LLVM dependencies, the current implementation is limited to Rust < 1.64. `cd` to the folder where you want to run `cargo symex` from and override the Rust version to be used as below:

```shell
cd <folder>
rustup override set 1.64
```

Required dependencies for `symex-llvm-14-legacy`

- [LLVM](https://llvm.org/), used as a library for decoding the LLVM-IR (internal representation)
  of the program under analysis.

SMT solver defaults to `boolector`. It is possible to use Z3 instead of Boolector by using the feature flag `z3`.

- [boolector](https://github.com/Boolector/boolector), Boolector is a Satisfiability Modulo Theories
  (SMT) solver for the theories of fixed-size bit-vectors, arrays and uninterpreted functions.
- [Z3](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3), Z3 is a theorem prover from Microsoft Research.

To use the devcontainer with this setup, see the notes in `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json`.

## Debug output from SYMEX

The implementation uses the Rust log framework. You can set the logging level to the environment variable `RUST_LOG`. See below example (assumes the cargo-sub command `symex`).

```shell
> RUST_LOG=DEBUG cargo symex ...
```

If you want to narrow down the scope of logging you can give a list of modules to log.

```shell
> RUST_LOG="symex=debug" cargo symex ...
```

Symex uses different logging levels:

- info, high level logging of steps taken.
- debug, general logging of important actions.
- trace, further information on internal operations and data structures.

You can also narrow down the scope to specific modules, e.g. the executor.

```shell
> RUST_LOG="symex::executor=trace" cargo symex ...
```
