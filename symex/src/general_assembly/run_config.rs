//! Struct to configure the symbolic execution.
//! Here various types of custom hooks can be added to being able to simulate
//! specific setups in the symbolic execution. All hooks can be used to exchange
//! generic functionality with a provided function to carry out case specific
//! functionality.
//!
//! Writing a hook function can meaningfully alter how the symbolic execution is
//! carried out. Therefore it is advised that one familiarizes oneself with the
//! inner workings of Symex executor before writing a hook function.
